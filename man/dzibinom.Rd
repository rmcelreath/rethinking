\title{Zero-inflated binomial probability density}
\usage{
dzibinom(x, p_zero, size, prob, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Integer values to compute densities or probabilies of}

\item{p_zero}{Probability of a zero from bernoulli process}

\item{size}{Number of binomial trials}

\item{prob}{Probability of success in binomial trial}

\item{log}{If \code{TRUE}, returns log-probability instead of probability}
}
\description{
Functions for computing density and producing random samples from a
zero-inflated binomial probability distribution.
}
\details{
These functions provide density and random number calculations for
zero-inflated binomial observations. This distribution is defined as a
finite mixture of zeros and binomial values, where \code{p_zero} determines
the weight of the pure zeros. As such, the probability of a zero is
\code{p_zero + (1-p_zero)(1-prob)^size}. And the probability of a non-zero
value \code{x} is \code{(1-p_zero) choose(size,x) prob^x (1-prob)^(size-x)}.

\code{dzibinom} does its calculations in a way meant to reduce numerical
issues with probabilities close to 0 and 1. As a result, it's not very fast.
