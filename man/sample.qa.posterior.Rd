\title{Samples from quadratic posterior densities of models}
\usage{
sample.qa.posterior(model, n = 10000, clean.names = TRUE,
  model.weights = "AICc", nobs = 0, add.names = FALSE, fill.na = 0,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fit model object}

\item{n}{Number of samples to draw from joint posterior}

\item{model.weights}{If passing a list of models, method for computing
posterior probability of each model family. Can be "AIC","AICc","BIC" or a
vector of numeric weights.}

\item{nobs}{Number of observations used to fit model or all models in list.
Sometimes needed for \code{model.weights} values, like \code{AICc}.}

\item{add.names}{Adds a column of model names, when passing a list of models}

\item{fill.na}{Fills missing values with 0, by default, for model families
that do not contain a given parameter. Useful for linear models. Hazardous
for non-linear ones.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, prints various debugging information}

\item{models}{A list of fit models of the same class}
}
\description{
Samples from the posterior density of a fit model or models, assuming
multivariate normal density.
}
\details{
This is a legacy function and is no longer supported nor unit tested.

This function provides a way to draw parameter values from a multivariate
normal posterior density, estimated from the maximum a posterieri (MAP)
estimates and variance-covariance (\code{vcov}) of a fit model or models.

When passing a single fit model object, the function returns a data frame in
which each row is a sample and each column is a parameter.

When passing a list of fit model objects, the function returns a data frame
containing samples from the joint posterior across model families. The
fraction of rows drawn from a specific model family is determined by the
\code{model.weights} parameter. BIC, AIC, or AICc are used to compute
approximate predictive probabilities of each model family, and the total
samples \code{n} is proportioned according to these estimates. The user can
also supply a numeric vector of model weights, computed by any method. This
vector should sum to 1.
